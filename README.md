# WebDev

This project was created as part of a course in Web Development and is worth 5 ECTS (1 full year of academic studies: 60 ECTS credits). 

The website utilizes basic HTML and CSS syntax without any JS. 

The website was created for a imaginary customer called "Makeup Monkey". The customer in question sells 
makeup and needed a basic website to display contact information, products and to give a professional look for the company. Wih some imagination 
all of the text on the website was made up in order for the project to have a more humoristic approach. 

The reflective report for this project can be found in Swedish under the gallery folder in:
